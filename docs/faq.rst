Where can I get help?
--------------------------------------------------
For usage questions, please contact us via the `JuliaOpt mailing list <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/julia-opt>`_.
If you're running into bugs or have feature requests, please use the `Github Issue Tracker <https://github.com/cvxgrp/Convex.jl/issues>`_. 

Where can I learn more about Convex Optimization?
--------------------------------------------------
See the freely available book `Convex Optimization <http://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/>`_ by Boyd and Vandenberghe for general background on convex optimization.
For help understanding the rules of Disciplined Convex Programming, we recommend this [DCP tutorial website](http://dcp.stanford.edu/).

Are there similar packages available in other languages?
-----------------------------------------------------------
Indeed! You might use `CVXPY <http://www.cvxpy.org>`_ in Python, or `CVX <http://cvxr.com/>`_ in Matlab.

How does Convex.jl work?
