=========================================
Convex.jl - Convex Optimization in Julia
=========================================

Convex.jl is a Julia package for `Disciplined Convex Programming <http://dcp.stanford.edu/>`_. Convex.jl can solve

  * linear programs
  * mixed-integer programs
  * dcp-compliant convex programs including

    - second-order cone programs (SOCP)
    - exponential cone programs
    - semidefinite programs (SDP)

Convex.jl supports a variety of solvers, including `Mosek <https://github.com/JuliaOpt/Mosek.jl>`_, `Gurobi <https://github.com/JuliaOpt/gurobi.jl>`_, `ECOS <https://github.com/JuliaOpt/ECOS.jl>`_, `SCS <https://github.com/karanveerm/SCS.jl>`_ and `GLPK <https://github.com/JuliaOpt/GLPK.jl>`_ through the `MathProgBase <http://mathprogbasejl.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_ interface.

Note that Convex.jl was previously called CVX.jl. This package is under active development; we welcome bug reports and feature requests. For usage questions, please contact us via the `JuliaOpt mailing list <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/julia-opt>`_.
